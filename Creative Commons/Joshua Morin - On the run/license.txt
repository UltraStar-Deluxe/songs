"On the run"
(Joshua Morin)

So far away from home
so far away that I don't know
where my home is anymore
Twenty-one to be someone
see the world before it's gone
I wish I were back in school
On the run, down a one way street
On the run, the road beneath my feet
On the run, well I should be seeing you soon
Twenty-two to see you soon
So many things I've got to do
Like I've got to leave this place behind
In every town a different face
Even now I can't displace
From all the freedom on my mind
Twenty-three to believe
To live my life toward my dream
But this dream never stays the same
A half ticket ready in my hand
Round ticket to where I began
Just fight the urge to run away
I have been thinking about the past
I can't remember where I am
I'm coming home
So far away from home
So far that I don't know
Where my head is anymore
Two kids and a wife
To the place in my mind
Every once in a while, and there I'm
