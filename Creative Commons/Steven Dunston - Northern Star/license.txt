"Northern Star"
(Steven Dunston)

I am a keeper
Of promises and lies
And I'm a believer
In things I can't deny

I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost at any cost
As long as I can find my way again

Millions of lights in the midnight sky
Trying to guide me along
Some of them wander, and some lights fade
Others would steer me wrong
Millions of lights in the midnight sky,
None of them bright as you are
I'll set my course by you
My northern star

I am a seeker
who cares not what he finds
And I am a healer
Of any wounds but mine

I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost at any cost
As long as I can find my way again

Millions of lights in the midnight sky
Trying to guide me along
Some of them wander, and some lights fade
Others would steer me wrong
Millions of lights in the midnight sky
But none of them bright as you are
I'll set my course by you
My Northern Star
